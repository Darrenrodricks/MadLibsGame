* This was the first project that I completed this week. I was struggling with understanding the concept of understanding what Mad Libs was, this was a game I never heard of and when I figured it out my main struggle was creating accessible lines. When I first started I created a loop there were many lines which cannot be accessed. Once I was able to do this I spent a majority of time  making small changes to improve the interface and optimize the code.!
